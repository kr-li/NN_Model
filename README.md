# NN_Model
Using NN to predict the salesdata

This project builds a neural network model. 
With the content of the historical sales data in the CSV file, the neural network is trained and tested. 
The model is then used to predict the data of goods that have not yet been sold to see whether they can be sold. 
And the neural network accuracy and loss degree graphs are drawn. 
The confounding matrix graph and ROC graph of training results are drawn.
